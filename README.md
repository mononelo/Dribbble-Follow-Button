Dribbble follow button
----------------------

So, you want a super simple dribbble button on your website? That's fairly easy to do. Just put the following two lines of code wherever you want the button to appear on your site.

    <a class="dribbble-follow-button" href="http://dribbble.com/thom">Follow</a>
    <script src="http://static.tumblr.com/ylbvj5j/57Tmf37r9/dribbbler.js"></script>

Check out the button on thom.im &rarr; [demo](http://thom.im)

Options
-------

Change the username **thom** to your own username, obviously. Add a class of **disableCount** to the `<a>` to disable the follower-counter which is displayed next to the button. If you want a different title on your button, just edit the text inside the `<a>`.
